       "      <td>Time to Sell Apple Puts In case you missed the meteoric run in Apple  over the last several months, there may still be a way to profit without having to chase the stock at these lofty levels: selling puts. When you sell puts you in a sense become an insurance salesman. You agree to buy the stock at some point in the future, should the stock fall to that level or lower before a given date. For this agreement, you receive a premium up front.    With Apple currently trading at $210/share, just off its 52-week high, I propose selling out-of-the-money puts for April or July. The April $190 contract bids at $8.15 and the July $180 contract bids at $10.25.     I chose such long-dated contracts for their healty premiums. Just a reminder that the first rule of thumb with selling puts is to only sell puts on a stock you would be willing to own. Since I firmly believe in Apple's fundamentals and future business prospects, I would willingly buy the stock at $190 in April. However, nothing is certain, and Apple shares currently have a lot of positive news already \"baked in\".     If the upcoming tablet is a flop or never arrives at all, or if the company somehow misses earnings forecasts, the stock price may fall sharply. Since I agree with most analysts that Apple will earn roughly $11-12 in non-GAAP EPS in FY2010 and that a $240-260 price target is reasonable, selling out-of-the-money puts appears to be a great way to generate income and set the price you would be willing to pay for Apple shares. Therefore, it is my bet that Apple will stay above $190 by April and $180 by July and the put options will expire worthless, giving the seller a nice premium for either contract.</td>\n",

       "0  Time to Sell Apple Puts In case you missed the meteoric run in Apple  over the last several months, there may still be a way to profit without having to chase the stock at these lofty levels: selling puts. When you sell puts you in a sense become an insurance salesman. You agree to buy the stock at some point in the future, should the stock fall to that level or lower before a given date. For this agreement, you receive a premium up front.    With Apple currently trading at $210/share, just off its 52-week high, I propose selling out-of-the-money puts for April or July. The April $190 contract bids at $8.15 and the July $180 contract bids at $10.25.     I chose such long-dated contracts for their healty premiums. Just a reminder that the first rule of thumb with selling puts is to only sell puts on a stock you would be willing to own. Since I firmly believe in Apple's fundamentals and future business prospects, I would willingly buy the stock at $190 in April. However, nothing is certain, and Apple shares currently have a lot of positive news already \"baked in\".     If the upcoming tablet is a flop or never arrives at all, or if the company somehow misses earnings forecasts, the stock price may fall sharply. Since I agree with most analysts that Apple will earn roughly $11-12 in non-GAAP EPS in FY2010 and that a $240-260 price target is reasonable, selling out-of-the-money puts appears to be a great way to generate income and set the price you would be willing to pay for Apple shares. Therefore, it is my bet that Apple will stay above $190 by April and $180 by July and the put options will expire worthless, giving the seller a nice premium for either contract.   \n",
